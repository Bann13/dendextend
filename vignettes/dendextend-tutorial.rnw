\section{Introduction}

\subsection{The \code{dendrogram} object}


The \code{dendrogram} class provides general functions for handling tree-like structures in \proglang{R} \citep{R:Main}. It is intended as a replacement for similar functions in hierarchical clustering and classification/regression trees, such that all of these can use the same engine for plotting or cutting trees.

A dendrogram object represents a tree as a nested \code{list} object, with various attributes.

Dendrogram has several useful methods bundled with R:

<<>>=
methods(class="dendrogram")
@

For example, let's create a dendrogram object based on an hierarchical clustering of 4 states in the U.S.:

<<>>=
# our data:
data(USArrests)
US_data <- USArrests[c(2,5,32,35),]
print(US_data)

hc <- hclust(dist(US_data), "ave") # create an heirarchical clustering object
dend <- as.dendrogram(hc)
@


Below are examples for some dendrogram methods:

<<out.width="4in", out.height="4in",fig.align='center'>>=
print(dend)
labels(dend)
str(dend)
str(dend[[2]]) # looking at one branch of the dendrogram
plot(dend)
@

You might notice how the order of the items (leaves/terminal nodes) of the dendrogram is different than their order in the table. In order to re-order the rows in the data-table to have the same order as the items in the dendrogram, we can use the \code{order.dendrogram} function:

<<>>=
(new_order <- order.dendrogram(dend)) 
# the order of the original items to have them 
# be at the same order as they assume in the dendrogram
print(US_data[new_order,])
@


In order to see what our dendrogram (\code{list}) object includes, we need to use the \code{unclass} function, which will strip away the class attribute and will allow us to print the list as is, without going through the \code{print.dendrogram} method. We can see how each node in the dendrogram/list object has the following (self explaining) attributes:

<<>>=
str(unclass(dend))
@


Notice how terminal nodes uses the "leaf" attribute (set to TRUE).
<<>>=
names(attributes(dend)[-4])
@



A very important function is \code{dendrapply}. It applies some function recursively to each node of a dendrogram. It is often used for adjusting attributes of the object, or extracting something from it. 

One current "feature" with this function is that just sending a dendrogram through it will return it with each of its nodes becoming of class "dendrogram". Notice the use of the \code{unclass_dend} function. Example:

<<>>=
# dendrapply(dend, unclass) # in case the  
itself <- function(x) x
dend_from_dendrapply <- dendrapply(dend, itself)

# here we must first use unclass since "[[]]" inherits its class to the output:
class(unclass(dend)[[2]])
class(unclass(dend_from_dendrapply)[[2]])
class(unclass_dend(dend_from_dendrapply)[[2]]) # the new uncless_dend solves it.
@



\subsection{Motivation for creating \code{dendextend}}



The \code{dendrogram} object has several \textbf{advantages}:

\begin{enumerate}
   \item \code{dendrogram} objects are simply list R objects. This makes their structure  very simple to understand by R users.
   \item \code{dendrogram} objects has various methods and functions for using them in R. 
   \item \code{dendrogram} objects are relatively simple to manipulate and extend.
   \item Other tree objects (such as *hclust*, and objects from the *{ape}* package) include an *as.dendrogram* method for converting their objects into a dendrogram.
\end{enumerate}


However, even with all of its advantages, the \code{dendrogram} class in R still lacks various basic features.

The \code{dendextend} package aims at filling some gaps in base R, by extending the available functions for dendrogram manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization.

This vignettes Provides a step-by-step description of the functionality provided by the \code{dendextend} package.


\subsection{Installing \code{dendextend}}

To install the stable version from CRAN use:

<<eval=FALSE>>=
install.packages('dendextend') # not yet available from CRAN
@


To install the \href{https://github.com/talgalili/dendextend}{GitHub version} use:

<<eval=FALSE>>=
if (!require('devtools')) install.packages('devtools'); require('devtools')
install_github('dendextend', 'talgalili')
@


\section{Tree labels (extraction, assignment, length)}


\subsection{labels in base R}

In base R, the \code{labels} function is intended to find/extract a suitable set of labels from an object for use in printing or plotting, for example. By default, it uses the \code{names} and \code{dimnames} functions.

What base R \code{labels} function is missing is assignment. In the next few examples we will go through different examples of what the \code{dendextend} package offers for various objects.

\textbf{Credits:} These assignment functions were originally written by Gavin Simpson (in a post on \href{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4614223/how-to-have-the-following-work-labelsx-some-value-r-question}{(stackoverflow)}), and adopted/adjusted to this package by Tal Galili. Some modification were inspired by Gregory Jefferis's code from the \pkg{dendroextras} package.


\subsection{labels for vectors and matrices}

In base R, for vectors, labels gives the \code{names} of the object. And if these are missing, then \code{labels} will give the vector itself as a character vector:

<<>>=
x <- 1:3 
names(x) # this vector has no names
labels(x) # this vector has no labels
@

Assignment to names is available in base R and works as follows:

<<>>=
x <- 1:3 
names(x) <- letters[1:3] # assignment for names is in base R
#both names and labels will give the same result:
names(x) 
labels(x)

@


The new labels assignment function will allow a user to change the labels of the vector just as if it was "names":

<<>>=
x <- 1:3 
labels(x) <- letters[1:3]
names(x) 
labels(x)
@

Labels assignment are also available for matrices.


\subsection{labels for dendrogram objects}

We can get a dendrogram's labels using the \code{labels} function from base R. However, in order to assign new values to it, we'll need the assignment function from \pkg{dendextend}:

<<>>=
labels(dend) # from base R
set.seed(2354235)
labels(dend) <- sample(labels(dend)) # labels assingment - thanks to dendextend
labels(dend)
@


\subsection{labels for hclust objects}

\pkg{dendextend} offers a \code{labels} method for \code{hclust} objects. It take special care to have the order of the labels be the same as is with dendrogram object, which is the order of the labels in the plotted tree. This can be turned off when using the \code{order} parameter:

<<>>=
# All are from dendextend
labels(hc) 
labels(hc,order=FALSE) # this is the order of the rows of the original data.
set.seed(229835)
labels(hc) <- sample(labels(hc)) # labels assingment - thanks to dendextend
labels(hc)
@


\subsection{labels assignment and recycling}

When the assigned vector has a different length, the \pkg{dendextend} assignment functions will recycle the value but also give a warning:

<<>>=

x <- 1:3   
hc <- hclust(dist(US_data), "ave")
dend <- as.dendrogram(hc)
y <- matrix(1:9, 3,3)   

labels(x) <- "bob"
labels(x)
labels(hc) <- "bob"
labels(hc)
labels(dend) <- "bob"
labels(dend)
labels(y) <- "bob"
labels(y)

@


\subsection{Tree size}

Getting the size of a tree (e.g: number of leaves/terminal-nodes) is good for validation of functions, and also when we wish to initiate a variable to later fill with data from the leaves. 

The \code{labels} function for dendrogram is expensive, since it uses recursion to get all of the tree's elements. If we are only interested in getting the tree size, it is better to use the \code{nleaves} function. It has an S3 method for hclust, dendrogram and phylo (from the \pkg{ape}):

<<>>=
nleaves(hc)
nleaves(dend)
@

For dendrograms the speed improvement is about 10 times using \code{labels}, whereas for hclust, there is not any gain made by using \code{nleaves}. Here is a quick benchmark:

<<cache=TRUE>>=
library(microbenchmark)
microbenchmark(nleaves(dend), length(labels(dend)))
microbenchmark(nleaves(hc), length(labels(hc)))
@

There are border-line cases where the node above some leaves is of height 0. In such a case, we would consider that node as a "terminal node", and in order to count the number of such terminal nodes we would use \code{count_terminal_nodes} function. For example:

<<out.height="3in",fig.align='center'>>=

hc <- hclust(dist(USArrests[1:3,]), "ave")
dend <- as.dendrogram(hc)

par(mfrow = c(1,2))

###
# Trivial case
count_terminal_nodes(dend) # 3 terminal nodes
length(labels(dend)) # 3 - the same number
plot(dend, 
   main = "This is considered a tree \n with THREE terminal nodes/leaves") 

###
# NON-Trivial case
str(dend)
attr(dend[[2]], "height") <- 0
count_terminal_nodes(dend) # 2 terminal nodes, why? see this plot:
# while we have 3 leaves, in practice we have only 2 terminal nodes
# (this is a feature, not a bug.)
plot(dend,
   main = "This is considered a tree \n with TWO terminal nodes only") 

@


\section{Tree manipulation}

\subsection{Unrooting and root height}

A tree's nodes has various heights. Sometimes we are interested in changing the height of the entire tree. It is useful when This can be accomplished using \code{raise.dendrogram}. For example (notice how the entire tree's height is changed):

<<out.height="3in",fig.align='center'>>=

hc <- hclust(dist(USArrests[1:3,]), "ave")
dend <- as.dendrogram(hc)

taller_dend <- raise.dendrogram(dend, 10)
shorter_dend <- raise.dendrogram(dend, -10)

attr(dend, "height") # 54.80041
attr(taller_dend, "height") # 64.80041
attr(shorter_dend, "height") # 44.80041

par(mfrow = c(1,3))
plot(dend, ylim = c(0, 70), main = "Original dend"); abline(h = c(40, 50, 60), lty = 2)
plot(taller_dend, ylim = c(0, 70), main = "Taller dend"); abline(h = c(40, 50, 60), lty = 2)
plot(shorter_dend, ylim = c(0, 70), main = "Shorter dend"); abline(h = c(40, 50, 60), lty = 2)

@



Sometimes we wish to "unroot" the dendrogram, meaning that we merge one of the tree's branches with its root. This is useful, for example, when merging phylogenetic trees from several families, and being unwilling to assume a specific root to the merged trees. Unrooting can be done using the \code{unroot} (S3) function (notice the use of the \code{branch_becoming_root} parameter):


<<out.height="3in",fig.align='center'>>=

hc <- hclust(dist(USArrests[10:13,]), "ward")
dend <- as.dendrogram(hc)

unrooted_dend <- unroot(dend, branch_becoming_root=1)
unrooted_dend_2 <- unroot(unrooted_dend, branch_becoming_root=3)

par(mfrow = c(1,3))
plot(dend)
plot(unrooted_dend)
plot(unrooted_dend_2)

@

While the \code{unroot.hclust} method exists, it is not expected to work since \code{hclust} objects are not designed to handle non-binary trees (hence the advantage of using \code{dendrogram} objects). For \code{phylo} objects (from the \pkg{ape} package), there is also a method that would simply use \code{ape:::unroot(phy = x)}.

In some rare cases, we might wish to equalize the heights of root's branches. For this we can use the \code{flatten.dendrogram} function:


<<fig.align='center'>>=

hc <- hclust(dist(USArrests[10:13,]), "ward")
dend <- as.dendrogram(hc)

flatten_dend_1 <- flatten.dendrogram(dend,FUN=max)
flatten_dend_2 <- flatten.dendrogram(dend,FUN=min)

par(mfrow = c(1,3))
plot(dend, main = "Original tree"); abline(h = c(50, 100), lty=2)
plot(flatten_dend_1, main = "Flatten tree \n(max branches height)"); abline(h = c(50, 100), lty=2)
plot(flatten_dend_2, main = "Flatten tree \n(min branches height)"); abline(h = c(50, 100), lty=2)

@




\subsection{Coloring labels of leaves}


<<>>=
require(colorspace)

@



\subsection{Trimming leaves}

Trimming a tree from some leaves can be done using the \code{trim} (S3 method) function (notice that the attributes of the trimmed tree are updated):

<<out.height="3in",fig.align='center'>>=

hc <- hclust(dist(USArrests[1:5,]), "ave")
dend <- as.dendrogram(hc)
trimmed_dend <- trim(dend , c("Alaska", "California"))

str(unclass(trimmed_dend))

par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(dend, main = "original tree")
plot(trimmed_dend, main = "tree without Alaska and California")

@

If we have two trees, we can use the \code{intersect_trees} function to reduce both trees to have the same labels (this will be useful later when we'd like to compare the two trees):


<<fig.align='center'>>=

hc_1 <- hclust(dist(USArrests[1:5,]), "single")
hc_2 <- hclust(dist(USArrests[1:5,]), "complete")
dend_1 <- as.dendrogram(hc_1)
dend_2 <- as.dendrogram(hc_2)

trimmed_dend_1 <- trim(dend_1 , c("Alaska"))
trimmed_dend_2 <- trim(dend_2 , c("California"))

dends_12 <- intersect_trees(trimmed_dend_1,trimmed_dend_2)

par(mfrow = c(3,2))
plot(dend_1, main = "Tree - single method", ylim = c(0,110))
plot(dend_2, main = "Tree - complete method", ylim = c(0,110))
plot(trimmed_dend_1, main = "Trimmed tree - single method", ylim = c(0,110))
plot(trimmed_dend_2, main = "Trimmed tree - complete method", ylim = c(0,110))
plot(dends_12[[1]], main = "Intersected tree - single method", ylim = c(0,110))
plot(dends_12[[2]], main = "Intersected tree - complete method", ylim = c(0,110))

\section{Summary}

The \pkg{dendextend} package presented in this paper greatly extends the available functionality of the dendrogram objects in \proglang{R}.

% compiled \proglang{C++} code with \proglang{R}.
% \pkg{dendextend} provides a \proglang{C++} class hierarchy which allows manipulation of \proglang{R} data structures in \proglang{C++}
% using member functions and operators directly related to the type
% of object being used, thereby reducing the level of expertise
% required to master the various functions and macros offered by the
% internal \proglang{R} API. The classes assume the entire
% responsibility of garbage collection of objects, relieving the
% programmer from book-keeping operations with the protection stack
% and enabling him/her to focus on the underlying problem.
% 
% Data interchange between \proglang{R} and \proglang{C++} code is performed by the \code{wrap()} and
% \code{as()} template functions. They allow the programmer to write logic in terms
% of \proglang{C++} data structures, and facilitate use of modern libraries such as the
% Standard Template Library (STL) and its containers and algorithms. The
% \code{wrap()} and \code{as()} template functions are extensible by
% design. They are also used either explicitly or implicitly throughout the API.
% By using only thin wrappers around \code{SEXP} objects and adopting \proglang{C++}
% idioms such as iterators, the footprint of the \pkg{dendextend} API
% is very lightweight, and does not incur a significant performance penalty.
% 
% The \pkg{dendextend} API offers opportunities to dramatically reduce the complexity
% of code, which should lower the initial cost of writing code and improve code readability, maintainability, and
% reuse---without incurring noticeable penalties in run-time performance.
