dendextend 0.4 (2013-07-31) 
---------------------------

NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED: 
(including tests and documentation)
   * is.natural.number
   * cutree_1h.dendrogram - like cutree, but only for 1 height 
   * fix_members_attr.dendrogram - just to validate that trim works o.k.
   * hang.dendrogram - hangs a dendrogram leaves (also allows for a rotated hanged dendrogram), works also for non-binary trees.
   * nnodes - count the number of nodes in a tree
   * as.dendrogram.phylo - based on as.hclust.
   * get_nodes_attr - allows easy access to attributes of branches and leaves
   * get_branches_heights
   * fix_members_attr.dendrogram

UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * nleaves - added nleaves.phylo methods, based on as.hclust so it could be improved in the future.


dendextend 0.3 (2013-07-27) 
---------------------------

NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED:
   * removed "flip", added rev.hclust instead (since rev.dendrogram already exists)

NEW VIGNETTES SECTIONS ADDED:
   * Vignettes created (using LaTeX)
   * Basic introduction to dendrogram objects
   * Labels extraction and assignment, and measuring tree size.
   * Tree manipulation: unrooting, trimming, label coloring, rotation

NEW TESTS ADDED:
   * labels extraction, assignment and tree size (especially important for comparing hclust and dendrogram!)
   * Tree manipulation: unrooting, trimming, label coloring, rotation

UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * "labels.hclust" - added the "order" parameter. (based on some ideas from Gregory Jefferis's dendroextras package)
   * "labels.hclust" and "labels.hclust<-" - now both use order=TRUE as default. this makes them consistent with labels.dendrogram. Proper tests have been implemented.
   * "labels<-.dendrogram" - make sure the new dendrogram does not have each of its node of class "dendrogram" (which happens when using dendrapply)
   * unclass_dend - now uses dendrapply
   * get_branches_attr - added "warning" parameter
   * unroot.dendrogram - Can now deal with unrooting more than 3 branches. supresses various warnings. 
   * as_hclust_fixed - now works just as as.hclust when hc is missing.
   * rotate - allowed "order" to accept character vector.


OTHER NOTES:
   * Extending the documentation for: rotate, labels.hclust,
   * Added a welcome massage to when loading the package (zzz.r file added)
   * Added a first template for browseVignettes(package ='dendextend')
   * Added a tests folder - making the foundation for using testthat.
      * Added tests for labels assignment
   * Added a clear GPL-2+ copyright notice on each r file.
	* Forcing {ape} to load before {dendextend}, thus allowing for both rotate and unroot to work for BOTH packages. It does add extra noise when loading the package, but it is the best solution I can think of at this point.

dendextend 0.2 (2013-04-10) 
---------------------------

NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED:
   * count_terminal_nodes
   * labels_colors (retrieving and assignment)
   * unclass_dend
   * head.dendrogram (S3 method for dendrogram)
   * nleaves (with S3 methods for dendrogram and hclust)
   * rotate (with S3 methods for dendrogram, hclust and phylo)
   * sort (with S3 methods for dendrogram and hclust)
   * flip (works for both dendrogram and hclust)
   * trim - trims leaves off a dendrogram/hclust/phylo trees. (based on the trim_leaf function)
   * as_hclust_fixed
   * get_branches_attr
   * unroot (dendrogram/hclust/phylo)
   * raise.dendrogram
   * flatten.dendrogram
   * order.dendrogram<-
   * intersect_trees

UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * "labels<-.dendrogram" - made sure to allow shorter length of labels than the size of the tree (now uses recycling).  This version is now sure to deal correctly with labeling trees with duplicate labels.

OTHER NOTES:
   * From here on I will be using "." only for S3 method functions.  Other functions will use "_"
   * Added more .r files, and changed the locations of some functions.

dendextend 0.1 (2013-04-05) - FIRST version!
--------------------------------------------

NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED:
   * S3 methods for label assignment operator for vector, dendrogram, hclust, matrix.

OTHER NOTES:
	* Includes skeletons for some functions that will be added in the future.
	

	

TODO for future releases:
-------------------------
   * add functions...
   * Fix the demo / or work on a nice vignette
   * add a print/warn parameter to intersect_trees
   * add rect.hclust.nice http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4720307/change-dendrogram-leaves 
   * Give this a thought: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10088117/exporting-dendrogram-as-table-in-r?rq=1
   * possibly use {dendroextras} to add colors to the tanglegrams. also: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10571266/colouring-branches-in-a-dendrogram-in-r?rq=1
   * create rect.dendrogram (and make rect generic). http://stackoverflow.com/questions/717747/how-do-i-color-edges-or-draw-rects-correctly-in-an-r-dendrogram
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4720307/change-dendrogram-leaves
   * hide some function's doc (labels<-.stuff)
   * cite agnes/cluster and http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cluster/cluster.pdf
   Maybe also spantree {vegan}
   * boot_dend - create a same-size tree, while sampling (with repetition) the leaves! # later for boot
