dendextend 0.3 (2013-07-24) 
---------------------------

NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED:
   * 

NEW VIGNETTES SECTIONS ADDED:
   * Vignettes created (using LaTeX)
   * Basic introduction to dendrogram objects
   * Labels extraction and assignment

NEW TESTS ADDED:
   * labels extraction and assignment (especially important for comparing hclust and dendrogram!)


UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * "labels.hclust" - added the "order" parameter. (based on some ideas from Gregory Jefferis's dendroextras package)
   * "labels.hclust" and "labels.hclust<-" - now both use order=TRUE as default. this makes them consistent with labels.dendrogram. Proper tests have been implemented.
   * "labels<-.dendrogram" - make sure the new dendrogram does not have each of its node of class "dendrogram" (which happens when using dendrapply)

OTHER NOTES:
   * Extending the documentation for: rotate, labels.hclust,
   * Added a welcome massage to when loading the package (zzz.r file added)
   * Added a first template for browseVignettes(package ='dendextend')
   * Added a tests folder - making the foundation for using testthat.
      * Added tests for labels assignment
   * Added a clear GPL-2 copyright notice on each r file.
	

dendextend 0.2 (2013-04-10) 
---------------------------

NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED:
   * count_terminal_nodes
   * labels_colors (retrieving and assignment)
   * unclass_dend
   * head.dendrogram (S3 method for dendrogram)
   * nleaves (with S3 methods for dendrogram and hclust)
   * rotate (with S3 methods for dendrogram, hclust and phylo)
   * sort (with S3 methods for dendrogram and hclust)
   * flip (works for both dendrogram and hclust)
   * trim - trims leaves off a dendrogram/hclust/phylo trees. (based on the trim_leaf function)
   * as_hclust_fixed
   * get_branches_attr
   * unroot (dendrogram/hclust/phylo)
   * raise.dendrogram
   * flatten.dendrogram
   * order.dendrogram<-
   * intersect_trees

UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * "labels<-.dendrogram" - made sure to allow shorter length of labels than the size of the tree (now uses recycling).  This version is now sure to deal correctly with labeling trees with duplicate labels.

OTHER NOTES:
   * From here on I will be using "." only for S3 method functions.  Other functions will use "_"
   * Added more .r files, and changed the locations of some functions.

dendextend 0.1 (2013-04-05) - FIRST version!
--------------------------------------------

NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED:
   * S3 methods for label assignment operator for vector, dendrogram, hclust, matrix.

OTHER NOTES:
	* Includes skeletons for some functions that will be added in the future.
	

	

TODO for future releases:
-------------------------
   * add functions...
   * Fix the demo / or work on a nice vignette
   * add a print/warn parameter to intersect_trees
   * add rect.hclust.nice http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4720307/change-dendrogram-leaves 
   * Give this a thought: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10088117/exporting-dendrogram-as-table-in-r?rq=1
   * possibly use {dendroextras} to add colors to the tanglegrams
