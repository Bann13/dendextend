dendextend 0.7.2 (2013-08-13)
----------------------------

NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED: 
   * plotNode_horiz - allows the labels, in plot_horiz.dendrogram, to be aligned to the leaves tips when the tree is plotted horizontally, its leaves facing left.

UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * plot_horiz.dendrogram - allows the labels to be aligned to the leaves tips when the tree is plotted horizontally, its leaves facing left. (took a lot of digging into internal functions used by plot.dendrogram)
   * tanglegram - added the parameters: dLeaf_left dLeaf_right. Also, labels are now alligned to the leaves tips in the right dendrogram.



BUG FIXES: 
   * Fix untangle_step_rotate_1side to work with non-missing dend_heights_per_k
   * Set sort_cluster_numbers = TRUE for cutree, in order to make it compatible with stats:::cutree. Added a test for this.
   * Fix cutree.hclust to work with a vector of k when !order_clusters_as_data
   * Fix cutree.dendrogram to give default results as stats:::hclust does, by setting the default to sort_cluster_numbers = TRUE.


OTHER NOTES:
   * Variations of the changes to plot_horiz.dendrogram and plotNode_horiz should be added to R core in order to allow forward compatability.

   * tanglegram

NEW TESTS:
   * order.dendrogram gives warning and can be changed
   * fac2num works


dendextend 0.4 (2013-08-02) 
---------------------------

NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED: 
(including tests and documentation)
   * is.natural.number
   * cutree_1h.dendrogram - like cutree, but only for 1 height value.
   * fix_members_attr.dendrogram - just to validate that trim works o.k.
   * hang.dendrogram - hangs a dendrogram leaves (also allows for a rotated hanged dendrogram), works also for non-binary trees.
   * nnodes - count the number of nodes in a tree
   * as.dendrogram.phylo - based on as.hclust.
   * get_nodes_attr - allows easy access to attributes of branches and leaves
   * get_branches_heights
   * fix_members_attr.dendrogram
   * heights_per_k.dendrogram - get the heights for a tree that will yield each k cluster.
   * is.hclust
   * is.dendrogram
   * is.phylo
   * fac2num
   * as.phylo.dendrogram - based on as.hclust.
   
   * cutree_1k.dendrogram - like cutree, but only for 1 k (number of clusters) value.
   * cutree.dendrogram - like cutree but for dendrograms (and it is also vectorized)
   * cutree.hclust - like cutree but for hclust
   * cutree.phylo - like cutree but for phylo
   * sort_levels_values - make the resulting clusters from cutree to be ordered from left to right
   * cutree - with S3 methods for dendrogram/hclust/phylo

   * color_branches - color a tree branches based on its clusters. This is a modified version of the color_clusters function from jefferis's dendroextra package. It extends it by using my own version of cutree.dendrogram - allowing the function to work for trees that hclust can not handle (unrooted and non-ultrametric trees). Also, it allows REPEATED cluster color assignments to branches on to the same tree. Something which the original function was not able to handle. It also handles extreme cases, such as when the labels of a tree are integers.
   * color_labels - just like color_branches, but for labels.
   
   * assign_values_to_leaves_nodePar - allows for complex manipulation of dendrogram's leaves parameters.


UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * nleaves - added nleaves.phylo methods, based on as.hclust so it could be improved in the future.
   * "labels_colors<-" - fixed it so that by default it would not add phc=1 to the leaves.
   * "order.dendrogram<-" - now returns an integer (instead of numeric)
   * cutree (cutree.dendogram / cutree.hclust) - Prevent R from crashing when using 
cutree on a subset tree (e.g: dend[[1]])
   * Renaming the unroot function -> to -> unbranch 
   * get_leaves_attr - added a simplify parameter.

OTHER NOTES:
   * Updated the exact way the GPL was stated in DESCRIPTION and gave a better reference within each file.

NEW VIGNETTES SECTIONS ADDED:
   * Hanging trees
   * Coloring branches.
   

dendextend 0.3 (2013-07-27) 
---------------------------

NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED:
   * removed "flip", added rev.hclust instead (since rev.dendrogram already exists)

NEW VIGNETTES SECTIONS ADDED:
   * Vignettes created (using LaTeX)
   * Basic introduction to dendrogram objects
   * Labels extraction and assignment, and measuring tree size.
   * Tree manipulation: unrooting, trimming, label coloring, rotation

NEW TESTS ADDED:
   * labels extraction, assignment and tree size (especially important for comparing hclust and dendrogram!)
   * Tree manipulation: unrooting, trimming, label coloring, rotation

UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * "labels.hclust" - added the "order" parameter. (based on some ideas from Gregory Jefferis's dendroextras package)
   * "labels.hclust" and "labels.hclust<-" - now both use order=TRUE as default. this makes them consistent with labels.dendrogram. Proper tests have been implemented.
   * "labels<-.dendrogram" - make sure the new dendrogram does not have each of its node of class "dendrogram" (which happens when using dendrapply)
   * unclass_dend - now uses dendrapply
   * get_branches_attr - added "warning" parameter
   * unroot.dendrogram - Can now deal with unrooting more than 3 branches. supresses various warnings. 
   * as_hclust_fixed - now works just as as.hclust when hc is missing.
   * rotate - allowed "order" to accept character vector.


OTHER NOTES:
   * Extending the documentation for: rotate, labels.hclust,
   * Added a welcome massage to when loading the package (zzz.r file added)
   * Added a first template for browseVignettes(package ='dendextend')
   * Added a tests folder - making the foundation for using testthat.
      * Added tests for labels assignment
   * Added a clear GPL-2+ copyright notice on each r file.
	* Forcing {ape} to load before {dendextend}, thus allowing for both rotate and unroot to work for BOTH packages. It does add extra noise when loading the package, but it is the best solution I can think of at this point.

dendextend 0.2 (2013-04-10) 
---------------------------

NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED:
   * count_terminal_nodes
   * labels_colors (retrieving and assignment)
   * unclass_dend
   * head.dendrogram (S3 method for dendrogram)
   * nleaves (with S3 methods for dendrogram and hclust)
   * rotate (with S3 methods for dendrogram, hclust and phylo)
   * sort (with S3 methods for dendrogram and hclust)
   * flip (works for both dendrogram and hclust)
   * trim - trims leaves off a dendrogram/hclust/phylo trees. (based on the trim_leaf function)
   * as_hclust_fixed
   * get_branches_attr
   * unroot (dendrogram/hclust/phylo)
   * raise.dendrogram
   * flatten.dendrogram
   * order.dendrogram<-
   * intersect_trees

UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * "labels<-.dendrogram" - made sure to allow shorter length of labels than the size of the tree (now uses recycling).  This version is now sure to deal correctly with labeling trees with duplicate labels.

OTHER NOTES:
   * From here on I will be using "." only for S3 method functions.  Other functions will use "_"
   * Added more .r files, and changed the locations of some functions.
